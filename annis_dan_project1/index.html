			Hi Everyone. This is my splash page into my Project List.<br />
			I have not much to say on here but the page you are about to see is not working. I tried and tried to get things to work
			but nothing was playing nice as usual. Time is getting to due time, and my countless hours of effort failed to get the stuff
			to show. I'm creaing "keys" but nothing more. :(
